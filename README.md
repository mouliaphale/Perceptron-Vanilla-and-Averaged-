# Perceptron-Vanilla-and-Averaged
Vanilla perceptron algorithm as well as Averaged perceptron using only python inbuilt libraries to classify hotel reviews into positive, negative, truthful and deceptive. 

To train the model, run perceplearn3.py and then to use the model to classify, run percepclassify3.py
The code takes 1 input - The directory where review files(text) are stored, and writes the model parameters to two other text files which the code creates at runtime named vanillamodel.txt and averagedmodel.txt

The percepclassify3.py file creates another text file to write results in the format "label" and "name of file"
